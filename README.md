Signal K Plugin That Serves RAW n2k Data

I use this for developement and testing. You can configure another SK server to consume and send n2k data through the server running this plugin. This removes the need to have another N2K adaptor.

Setup a connection in the consumer instance as NMEA 2000, with source W2K-1 N2K ASCII.
